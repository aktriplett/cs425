- each computer has unique number, in 32bit (ip4 concept), this is ip address
  - should know server ip (who you are conencting to)
  - on a single server you can have multiple services running, you should know
    which port number a server is running out of

- need 2 C program files, one for server, one for client
- need to run server first, then client
- client needs to know server ip/port number to connect

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
1. client.c
2. server.c

- compile the client
cc client.c -o client.out (creates client.out)

-compile the server
cc server.c -o server.out (creates server.out)

NOW in one terminal, operate the server
./server.out 4547 (4547 is the specified port number)
- blinking cursor means the server is now in listening mode

open a second terminal to be the client
./clinet.out localhost 4547
